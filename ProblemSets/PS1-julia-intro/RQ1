1. Explain what identification means, according to Arthur Lewbel.
According to Arthur Lewbel, identification charactarizes the extent to which one can learned about a parameter based on observable data. 

2. Correctly order the following econometric actions in their logical sequence: estimation, hypothesis testing, identification, inference.
    1. Identification
    2. Estimation
    3. Inference
    4. Hypothesis Testing
    
3. What are the two characteristics of reduced-form causal methods, according to Lewbel? How is this different from structural methods?
    1. Instead of focusing on parameters, reduced-form causal methods rely on identifying and estimating treatment effects.
    2. Reduced-form causual methods use natural or experimental randomization as a key source of identification. For example, RCT's or IV's are
    common approaches in this literature. 

4. What does Lewbel refer to as "crude structural modeling"?
Lewbel considers causal analyses speculating about the wider implications of randomized treatment effects to be "crude structural modeling". 

5. What does Lewbel suggest is a way to overcome the external validity problem?
By combining casual methods with structural modeling, Lewbel argues that the researcher can overcome the external validity problem.  
Lewbel cites for example Rosenzweig and Udry (2016) who use structure to model how average treatment effects estimated from randomized control
trials vary with macro shocks such as the weather.
